# Game Logger
A personal logger for games, anime, and manga. The initial release of this project will contain the ability to track and
update games, anime, and manga you take part in. It's all local, and doesn't communicate with any outside API, so if
you're worried about safety then worry no further! And, of course, you can just check the code here if you're that
interested.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, feel free to message me or send me an email! I'd be glad to hear any
feed back and if you find any bugs please let me know. I'm still fairly new to programming, generally speaking, but I'm
always excited to make things!
